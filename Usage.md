# Library requirements #

the following python libraries are required to run the project:

general purpose:
    shapely
    matplotlib
    numpy
drone specific:
    cflib

# Algorithem #

To test the implementation of the algorithem, run test domain, which simulates the drone understanding of the space decompositon, this effecivly emulates the project without a physical drone


# Drone #

To test the implementation of the Drone, run DroneMainFile.py. This will require the crazyflie 2.0 or 2.1 with a flow deck and multiranger deck.
